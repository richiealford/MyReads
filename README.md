# MyReads Project

This is a react project that I implemented for the first project in Udacity's Nanadegree in React. It covers react fundementals including components, state management and lifecycyle events. The application is a book reading list application which enables users to search for new books and classify books into categories (shelfs) like read, reading, want to read. 


## Install Instructions

To run this react app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
